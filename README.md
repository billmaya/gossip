# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is an iPhone/iPad game that I was hired to port from Desktop Java
* It used to be published in the App Store
* You can view the development history at this link http://bit.ly/17MzjGc

### How do I get set up? ###

* It's written in C# .NET using the Xamarin Platform
* You'll have to download Xamarin platform to run the code - https://www.xamarin.com/platform
* To run open the Gossip/Gossip.sln file
* Right now it will run in the iOS simulator but not on any actual devices (there's a reflection exception error that's being thrown that I'm currently in the middle of debugging).
